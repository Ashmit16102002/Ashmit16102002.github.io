  <h3>Topic: Patterns, Entropy and Gibbs measures</h3>
  <strong>Instructor:</strong> Nishant Chandgotia, TIFR CAM, Bangalore<br>
  <p>Statistical physics attempts to explain natural physical phenomena like freezing and magnetism by means of simplistic probabilistic models. In this series of lectures, after building on prerequisites like ergodic theory, probability and information theory, we will introduce several models of statistical physics like the Ising model, hardcore model and the dimer model explaining how they arise and what we know about them. In between I also hope to introduce some open questions which have fascinated me for quite a few years like that of the Arctic circle phenomena, formation of quasicrystals and finiteness of phases of a simplistic class of models arising from graph homomorphisms.</p>

  <h3>Topic: Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS)</h3>
  <strong>Instructor:</strong> Sreekar Vadlamani, TIFR CAM, Bangalore<br>
  <p>Reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces have become a vital tool in numerous disciplines particularly in statistics/machine learning. It not only provides an alternate perspective of modelling problems in machine learning, but also provides a framework to answer several fundamental questions. In these lectures, we shall introduce the theory of RKHS through basic (finite dimensional) examples, and graduate to more intricate settings to unravel the full potential of RKHS. We shall also go through some pedagogical, and some realistic, applications of the RKHS tool.</p>

  <h3>Topic: Multiscale Problems in PDEs</h3>
  <strong>Instructor:</strong> M Vanninathan, TIFR CAM, Bangalore<br>
  <p>Starting with Continuum Mechanics Modelling, we see how multiscale problems arise in PDE in simple situations. Main feature of such problems is the  small scale variations of their solutions. Due to this, classical ideas of solving them fail, both theoretically and numerically. To overcome this difficulty, one of the ideas developed is  homogenization.  A surprising conclusion is that the original model PDE is not ideal in the presence of these small scales and a new approximate model is needed. I intend to demonstrate this by giving an introduction to some developments of Homogenization Theory.  I would like to cover the following chapters: Examples of Microstructures, Elliptic Homogenization, Effective coefficients associated with periodic structures and general structures,  Compensated Compactness, Effective set, Two-scale convergence, Bloch wave method etc.  Some possible applications will also be mentioned. </p>

  <h3>Gram matrices: connecting GPS triangulation, Euclidean metric embeddings, and Heron’s formula</h3>
  <strong>Speaker:</strong> Apoorva Khare, IISc Bangalore<br>
  <p>Gram matrices are ubiquitous in the literature, from theoretical to applied settings. This talk will showcase some of these appearances: they are covariance/correlation matrices, they are useful in understanding GPS trilateration, and they classically arose in understanding metric embeddings into Euclidean space. We will also see the entrywise transforms that send the class of Gram matrices into itself, and will end with the n-dimensional version of the well-known (and 2000-year old) Heron's formula.</p>

  <h3>Sobolev type inequalities and related problems.</h3>
  <strong>Speaker:</strong> Sandeep K, TIFR CAM, Bangalore<br>
  <p>Inequalities play an important role in the analysis of partial differential equations, one of the most important such inequalities is the Sobolev inequality. In many problems the sharp versions of these inequalities, best constants etc are required and these issues are connected with various other problems. In this talk we will discuss these issues and some of the related problems.</p>

  <h3>Distance between walks on graphs</h3>
  <strong>Speaker:</strong> Nishant Chandgotia, TIFR CAM, Bangalore<br>
  <p>A walk of length n on a finite undirected graph G, is a sequence of vertices (v_0, v_1, ... , v_n) such that v_i is adjacent to v_{i+1} for all i. We say that two walks (v_0, v_1, ... , v_n) and (w_0, w_1, ... , w_n) are adjacent if v_i is adjacent to w_i for all i. Let W_n be the graph whose vertices are walks of length n with the adjacency as described above. How does the diameter of W_n grow with n? In joint work with Silvère Gangloff, Benjamin Hellouin de Menibus and Piotr Oprocha, we study how this question relates to the problem of triviality of finite presented groups proving that it is undecidable.</p>

  <h3>The probabilistic method in analysis</h3>
  <strong>Speaker:</strong> Koushik Ramachandran, TIFR CAM, Bangalore<br>
  <p> Paul Erdos invented the probabilistic method to answer some questions in graph theory and combinatorics. In the last 50 years it has become clear that the probabilistic method is very general and is an useful tool in analysis, algebraic geometry, computer science, etc. In this talk I will introduce the probabilistic method as envisioned by Erdos but quickly move to some applications in harmonic and complex analysis. The talk should be accessible to students with a background in basic graduate level analysis, and discrete probability.</p>

  <h3>Ballot problem, Young tableaux and Non-intersecting paths</h3>
  <strong>Speaker:</strong> Manjunath Krishnapur, TIFR CAM, Bangalore<br>
  <p> In the ballot problem, there are k candidates who get votes a_1\ge a_2\ge ...\ge a_k. All the votes are placed in a box and drawn one after another at random while counting. What is the probability that at all times during the counting process, the first candidate is leading over the second candidate who is leading over the third and so on?


It turns out that this problem is equivalent to that of counting the number of standard or semi-standard Young tableau of a given shape (the terms will be defined in the lecture). And both problems are solved by a lemma of Karlin--Mcgregor and Lindstrom-Gessel-Viennot that gives a determinantal formula for the number of non-intersecting collections of paths with given starting and ending points in certain directed graphs.  Only very basic probability and linear algebra knowledge will be assumed. </p>

  <h3>Exact solvability of the dimer model</h3>
  <strong>Speaker:</strong> Terrence George, TIFR CAM, Bangalore<br>
  <p>The dimer model—originally a toy model for the adsorption of diatomic molecules on surfaces—has grown into a central object in statistical mechanics, combinatorics, discrete geometry, etc. In this talk, I will introduce the model from first principles and explore its exact solvability on planar graphs via Kasteleyn's remarkable determinant method.

  <h3>On the depth query problem for convex bodies</h3>
  <strong>Speaker:</strong> Purvi Gupta, IISc Bangalore<br>
  <p> typical example of a geometric query problem is that of polytope membership, the objective of which is to synthesize a given convex polytope K⊂Rd into a compact data structure that supports an efficient algorithm for determining whether a given query point q∈Rd is in K or not. More efficient algorithms can be designed if one considers the \emapproximate polytope membership problem where the membership data structure is allowed to answer incorrectly for points lying ε-close to the boundary of the polytope, where ε>0 is a fixed error. Recently, efficient data structures with optimal storage space and query time were constructed for this problem using more shape-sensitive objects such as Macbeath regions (Arya-da Fonseca-Mount, 2017; Abdelkader-Mount, 2018, 2024). A crucial ingredient in the analysis of these data structures is the Hilbert metric of K, which is a complete, projectively-invariant metric on K, for which straight lines give the shortest paths.
In this talk, we discuss a more refined version of the polytope membership problem. Given a convex body K⊂Rd, the depth of a query point q∈Rd is the maximum value δ∈[0,1) such that q lies outside all those half-spaces that contain δ proportion of the volume of K. We will discuss how the problem of determining the approximate depth of a query point can be converted into an approximate membership problem using the notion of convex floating bodies from convex geometry. We will then discuss the role of the Hilbert metric in the construction of a data structure to answer such queries. This is joint work with A. Narayanan.
